# odin-glfw

[Odin](https://github.com/gingerBill/Odin) bindings to GLFW 3.2.1 (at least)

odin-glfw only contain bindings to the C library, in addition to a few additional wrappers and utility functions (vararg window title and frame timings)

#### NOTE: Requires binaries to be available in system paths (in linux) or bundled with the exe (in windows).

#### NOTE: It is recommended to put this into the shared collection:
```
cd Odin/shared
git clone https://github.com/vassvik/odin-glfw.git
```
